         <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
         <p>Solomon starts out the book of Ecclesiastes talking about how Vain and how things have
             been since the beginning of time - following the same pattern over and over. How 
             compared to eternity everything is meaningless - rubbish. What I learned this week:</p>

<br><br><p>Wait: If you are patient things will happen, possibly better than you had hoped for or 
    imagined. Events in your life they will happen, there is no point in trying to speed
     things up God has a reason and a plan for everything in your life. All I am responsible
     for are the decisions I make, good or bad, stupid or smart. Including stuff I want to
      get. </p>

<br><br><p>Education/Knowledge: At the very end of the chapter Solomon says “For in much wisdom is much vexation and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow” knowing a lot can be a good thing or a bad thing I guess it can be a bad thing because when you know a lot and in Solomon’s case knowing everything it is easy to get prideful which leads to more problems and on the other hand it can be a good thing 
    being able to help others in this world overcome their challenges and hardships. </p> <br><br><h3> Wordcount = 201 <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OnE1S_Fnr3uxPT0iDXjPV8vZ6eIPasjJ2-yu0Se3nh4/edit?usp=sharing"> Google Docs</a></h3>
